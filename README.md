Learning Lua
============

This repository contains notes I have created for my series of instructional videos on learning Lua. 
While used for my personal programming development, this repository is available for anyone to use.
The video lessons can be found on my blog at (http://www.davidoshiro.com).

My plan is to update this repository with any new information that I pick up about programming in Lua.
